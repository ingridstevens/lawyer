      "Hello! You asked about the changes in German citizenship law, and I'm happy to provide you with a detailed overview of the recent modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The German citizenship law has undergone significant changes aimed at making the process of acquiring citizenship more accessible. Here are the key changes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **General Allowance of Dual Citizenship**: The new law allows for dual citizenship, meaning individuals will no longer have to renounce their previous nationality when acquiring German citizenship. This change eliminates the previous requirement that led to the loss of German citizenship upon obtaining a foreign nationality.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Easier Acquisition for Children**: Children born in Germany to foreign parents will automatically receive German citizenship without any conditions. This change removes the previous \"optionsregelung\" (options rule), which required these children to choose one nationality upon reaching adulthood (age 21).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reduced Residency Requirement**: The required period of legal residency in Germany for naturalization has been reduced from eight years to five years. This applies to both the parents of children born in Germany and to individuals seeking citizenship through naturalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Simplified Language Requirements**: For members of the \"guest worker generation\" and their families, the language proficiency requirement has been relaxed. They will only need to demonstrate oral language skills, and the citizenship test is no longer mandatory. A hardship clause has also been introduced, allowing for exceptions in cases where achieving the required language level is particularly difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Commitment to Democratic Values**: The law now includes a requirement for applicants to express a commitment to Germany's historical responsibility regarding the Nazi regime and to the principles of a democratic society. Failure to provide a truthful declaration can lead to exclusion from citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Digitalization of Processes**: The citizenship application process will be modernized, moving from analog to digital systems, which is expected to streamline procedures and improve efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "These changes reflect a broader effort to promote integration and recognize the contributions of long-term residents and their families to German society.\n",
      "\n",
      "For further details, you can refer to the following sources:\n",
      "- Deutscher Bundestag, Drucksache 20/10093: [Link](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/20/100/2010093.pdf)\n",
